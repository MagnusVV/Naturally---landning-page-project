# Naturally 
## the landning page project

Co-op project between DD22, CG22 &amp; WU22.

## About
Our first cross-collaboration project. The project groups were organised with two people each from the WU (web dev), CG (computer graphics), and DD (digital designers) courses. DD created the design, CG generated images and some moving graphics, and WU created the webpage. The result is a landing page for a fictitious company that sells organic and environmentally conscious products. It has got some limited interactiviy, and it's created mobile first.

It's written in HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS.
